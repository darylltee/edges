# Project EDGES Website

## Introduction

Built Using Velzon Admin Template version 2.3(currenty the new version is 4.2 as of June 2024) minimal template.

So far the project is just a template, We will be adding more features to it as time goes on.
As discussed previously, the whole website data is hardcoded, so in anticipation for the EDGES APP project we will be working on the backend API.
So I suggest we use this one but it's up to the team to decide. All suggestions are well accepted.

* BACKEND DB WITH REST `NOCODB` (https://github.com/nocodb/nocodb)


## TODO
1. Revise website based on the suggestions from the team.
2. Setup the backend API for the website including database schema.
3. Setup authentication and authorization using NOCODB.
4. Team meeting for the APP project.
5. More things to do.....
